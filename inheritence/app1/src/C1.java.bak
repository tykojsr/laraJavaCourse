// object for one class can be made in other class. no issues.

// compilation error because class D extends class C, it means class D has all the members of class C, so if we create
   an object for D class, its reference variable can be used to call both the methods. class C does not extend class D so
   all the members of class D is not inside class C, so if we create an object of class C,we can call only test1() by
   using its reference variable.
