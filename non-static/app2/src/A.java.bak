// what is constructor?
// it is a special type of method, but its not a regular method, internally compiler will be considering it a method
// the main difference btw a method and a constructor is that method must have a return type but constructor must not have a return type
// they r mainly used for initializing objects
// in each and every class if there is no constructor defined by the programmer then compiler obly keeps a default constructor which is no argument constructor(it does not take any argument)
/*
default constructor be like
A()
{
}
rules for constructor----
 1. constructor name must be same as class name(which is case sensitive)
 2. it must not have a return type
 3. constructors must be having a body. {}. they cannot be abstract
some general points------
 4. constructors must have access specifiers or access modifiers
 5. it can take any no of arguments
 6. they r executed while creating objects for that particular class.
