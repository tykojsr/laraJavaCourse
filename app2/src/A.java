/* if any one operand either left operand or right operand is a string or even both operands r string then it is called cancatination.
cancatination simply means addition.
in order to add something to the string we do cancatination.
in order to do mathematical addition cancatination is used
after cancatination entire value will become string. eg is above.  even 10 will come under semi colon
cancatination result always will be string because if one side is string then the final resul will always be final string
